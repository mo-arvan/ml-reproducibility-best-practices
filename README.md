# ml-reproducibility-best-practices

## Introduction

In this repository, we will establish and explore best practices for improving the reproducibility of machine learning projects. 

## Why?

Complexity and the usage of machine learning projects has significantly increased over the last decade. Consequently, the reproducibility of such projects has become an increasing challenge. While there have been a number of works that attempt to improve the gold standard, there are significant drawbacks and shortcomings that need to be addressed. Additionally, setting up a project based on the defined gold standard and best practices reduces the overall workload required to improve the reproducibility of machine learning projects. However

## How?

This steps are by no means comprehensive and are at their early stages, hence, if you do plan to use it, make sure to use the commit id. With the rapid pace of research in this field, standards need to be updated and released as new technologies are introduced. Therefore, these steps need to reach stable state and follow scheduled release versions and updates. 

- Utilizing docker 
  - Extending docker containers
  - Do not store datasets in your container.
